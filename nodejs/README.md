#### good
- Easy language and package management
- Huge ecosystem (community, libraries, frameworks, etc)
- Decent speed for what it does

#### bad
- Need to have some boilerplate for a simple decent project (typescript)
- Doesn't have the type safety and the speed of a compiled language

The runtime gives you alot of freedom of choice, this can be bad and good. The popularity factor is also a game changer, you will find tutorials for literally everything that you can imagine. This was the first time using the knex query builder, it was a easy and good experience
